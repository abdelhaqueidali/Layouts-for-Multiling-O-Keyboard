# Layouts-for-Multiling-O-Keyboard
Here, you can find DIY+ layouts for some languages to use with Multiling O Keyboard (MOK).
The main language I focused on is Amazigh, which is also known as Tamazight and Berber.
Recommended Layouts :
Amazigh : ⴰⵣⴻⵔⵜⵢ (Azerty-Full) and ⴷⵔⵎⵍ.
Arabic : Arabic (Gboard)
French : Azerty (Gboard)
...

Better use each layout with its language. You may need to avoid using latin script layouts with non-latin languages, and vise versa.
Amazigh (Tifinagh) is named Tifinagh ⵜⵉⴼⵉⵏⴰⵖ in MOK.
Amazigh (Latin) is named Tamaziɣt. It is also available under the names of Berber and Taqbaylit.
Moroccan Darija is not available, its latin layout can be used with Latin languages or Arabic.
