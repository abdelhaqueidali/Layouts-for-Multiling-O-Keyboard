# Layouts-for-Multiling-O-Keyboard
Here, you can find DIY+ layouts for some languages to use with [Multiling O Keyboard (MOK)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=kl.ime.oh).
<br>The main language I focused on is [Amazigh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berber_languages), also known as Tamazight and Berber, which I found that it has limited layouts in many keyboard apps for its script, [Tifinagh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tifinagh).
# Recommended Layouts :
<br>**Amazigh** : ⴰⵣⴻⵔⵜⵢ (Azerty), ⴰⵣⴻⵔⵜⵢ (Azerty-Full), and ⴷⵔⵎⵍ.
<br>**Arabic** : Arabic (Gboard)
<br>**French** : Azerty (Gboard)
<br>...

# Attention :
It is better to use each layout with its **specified language**.
<br>You may need to avoid using latin script layouts with languages that use non-latin scripts, and vise versa.
<br>**Amazigh (Tifinagh)** is named **Tifinagh ⵜⵉⴼⵉⵏⴰⵖ** in MOK.
<br>**Amazigh (Latin)** is named **Tamaziɣt**. It is also available under the names of Berber and Taqbaylit.
<br>**Moroccan Darija** is **not available**, its latin layout can be used with Arabic or any language that uses latin script.
