# Layouts-for-Multiling-O-Keyboard
DIY+ layouts for some languages to use with [Multiling O Keyboard (MOK)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=kl.ime.oh).
<br>The main language I focused on is [Amazigh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berber_languages), also known as Tamazight and Berber, which I found that it has limited layouts in many keyboard apps for its script, [Tifinagh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tifinagh).

# Attention :
It is better to use each layout with its **specified language**.

<br>**Amazigh (Tifinagh)** is named **Tifinagh ⵜⵉⴼⵉⵏⴰⵖ** in MOK, in Languages/7. Others.
<br>**Amazigh (Latin)** is named **Tamaziɣt** in Languages/1. Latin. It is also available under the names of Berber and Taqbaylit.
# User Dictionary :
You can use [User Dictionary Manager (UDM)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.usr.dict.mgr) to import the user dictionary.
 # Importing using UDM.
 First give storage permission to UDM, then allow it in **Keyboard list and default** so that it can act as a keyboard to be allowed to access the user dictionary of your phone. No need to set it as your keyboard.
