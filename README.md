# Layouts-for-Multiling-O-Keyboard
Here, you can find DIY+ layouts for some languages to use with Multiling O Keyboard (MOK).
The main language I focused on is Amazigh, also known as Tamazight and Berber, which I found that it has limited layouts in many keyboard apps.
# Recommended Layouts :
Amazigh : ⴰⵣⴻⵔⵜⵢ (Azerty-Full) and ⴷⵔⵎⵍ.
Arabic : Arabic (Gboard)
French : Azerty (Gboard)
...

# Attention :
It is better to use each layout with its specified language.
You may need to avoid using latin script layouts with languages that use non-latin scripts, and vise versa.
**Amazigh (Tifinagh)** is named **Tifinagh ⵜⵉⴼⵉⵏⴰⵖ** in MOK.
**Amazigh (Latin)** is named Tamaziɣt. It is also available under the names of Berber and Taqbaylit.
**Moroccan Darija** is not available, its latin layout can be used with Arabic or any language that uses latin script.
