# Layouts-for-Multiling-O-Keyboard
DIY+ layouts for some languages to use with [Multiling O Keyboard (MOK)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=kl.ime.oh).
<br>The main language I focused on is [Amazigh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berber_languages), also known as Tamazight and Berber, which I found that it has limited layouts in many keyboard apps for its script, [Tifinagh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tifinagh).
# Recommended Layouts :
<br>**Amazigh** : ⴰⵣⴻⵔⵜⵢ (Azerty), ⴰⵣⴻⵔⵜⵢ (Azerty-Full), and ⴷⵔⵎⵍ.
<br>**Arabic** : Arabic 1
<br>**French** : Azerty 1
<br>...

# Importing Layouts
After seting up Multiling O Keyboard as your keyboard, you should add the language you want. For example Tifinagh ⵜⵉⴼⵉⵏⵖ as it is names in MOK.
<br> Before following these steps, copy a layout code that you want from the repository. then:
<br>1. Open the keyboard, long press on space bar and drag it to layouts.
<br>2. Click on DIY+
<br>3. Click Paste to paste the copied layout code, then Ok.

# Importing Settings (Importing All the layouts at Once)
If you want to Import all the layouts at once, go to settings folder in this repository and copy the settings code.
<br>1. Then open the keyboard and long press on the gear icon and grag it to settings, or open them from the app itself.
<br>2. Go to Misc. then Import|Export, after that choose settings, click paste to paste the settings code you copied from the repository.
<br>3. Click Ok
<br>4. Now you shall get all the layouts and the theme green. After that you can go to change the settings you want, like auto correction.
# Attention :
It is better to use each layout with its **specified language**.
<br>You may need to avoid using latin script layouts with languages that use non-latin scripts, and vise versa.
<br>**Amazigh (Tifinagh)** is named **Tifinagh ⵜⵉⴼⵉⵏⴰⵖ** in MOK.
<br>**Amazigh (Latin)** is named **Tamaziɣt**. It is also available under the names of Berber and Taqbaylit.
<br>**Moroccan Darija** is **not available**, its latin layout can be used with Arabic or any language that uses latin script.
